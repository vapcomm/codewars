# codewars.com kata solutions

It's a storage for my katas solved on https://www.codewars.com/users/vapcomm

Feel free to use any code in this repository.

It was made as an Android Studio project to simplify my everyday Kotlin developer's life. Every solution has
tests taken from kata's tests with my additional tests.
